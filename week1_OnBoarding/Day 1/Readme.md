Version control is a system that records and manages changes to files over time. It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project, keeps track of different versions of the project, and facilitates easy rollback to previous versions if needed. Git is a popular distributed version control system widely used in software development.

GitHub is a web-based hosting service that provides a platform for version control using Git. It works exclusively with Git because Git offers several advantages, such as fast performance, distributed nature, and support for branching and merging. These features make it ideal for collaborative development and managing complex codebases.

To add Git to a project, you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize Git: Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory and run the command `git init`. This initializes a new Git repository in the directory, creating the necessary files and folders to track changes.

2. Stage files: Use the command `git add <file>` to stage files for the next commit. Staging means selecting specific files to include in the next snapshot of the project.

3. Commit changes: Use the command `git commit -m "Commit message"` to create a new commit. A commit represents a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time and contains a unique identifier (hash) and a commit message describing the changes.

4. Create branches: Git allows you to create branches to work on different features or parallel development paths. You can create a new branch using the command `git branch <branch-name>`. To switch to the new branch, use `git checkout <branch-name>`.

5. Merge branches: Once you have made changes in a branch and want to incorporate them into the main branch (typically called "master" or "main"), you can use the command `git merge <branch-name>`. This combines the changes from the specified branch into the current branch.

The main branch, often called the "master" or "main" branch, represents the stable and production-ready state of the project. It typically contains the code that is released to production. Branches, on the other hand, are separate lines of development. They allow you to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main branch. Once the changes in a branch are tested and reviewed, they can be merged back into the main branch. Branches enable parallel development and help manage complex projects with multiple contributors.
