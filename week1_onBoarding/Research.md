# Research About Back-end Development

## Back-end Development
Back-end development is all about creating and managing the server-side of a software application or website.
It's the implementation and maintenance of the behind-the-scenes functionality 
that powers the application and enables it to interact with databases, handle user authentication, process requests, and generate dynamic content.

Back-end developers primarily focus on the server-side components of an application, which include the server, the database, and the application's logic.
They work with programming languages and frameworks such as Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, Node.js, or .NET to build the server-side logic. 
They also interact with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB to store and retrieve data.

Back-end development is crucial for creating robust and scalable web applications and software systems. 
It requires a solid understanding of programming, databases, server administration, 
and various web technologies to build the foundation that supports the front end and delivers a dynamic and interactive user experience.

Back-end development enables web applications to be dynamic, secure, and personalized. 
It facilitates complex features like storing user data, providing recommendations based on that data, and ensuring data security through authentication and authorization.
It empowers the creation of sophisticated platforms such as e-commerce websites and social media networks

A website without back-end or server-side functionality can have a beautiful look but lacks the ability to offer complex and robust services.
It cannot support features like online stores, social media platforms, or student college websites that require data storage, user authentication, and dynamic content generation.
Back-end development is essential for creating meaningful and functional web applications with advanced capabilities.

## WebServers

A web server is a software application that handles the delivery of web content to clients, such as web browsers, upon receiving requests. 
When a user requests a web page or resource, the web server processes the request and sends the corresponding response back to the client.

**Here are Some of the Responsibilities of a Web Server:**

1- Store and protect website data: A web server can store and protect critical website data from unauthorized users.
2- Handling HTTP requests: Web servers primarily handle Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests.
They listen for incoming requests from clients, process them, and generate appropriate responses
3- Content delivery: Web servers are responsible for delivering static and dynamic content to clients.
Static content, such as HTML, CSS, and image files, is served directly from the file system.
Dynamic content, on the other hand, is generated by the web server by executing scripts (Back-End Script like PHP Code) or interacting with databases.
4- Hosting websites: Web servers host websites and make them accessible over the internet.
They store website resources and files and serve them to clients who Visit the website domain or IP address.
5- Handling server-side scripting: Web servers support various server-side scripting languages, such as PHP, Python, Ruby, or Node.js.
These languages allow developers to create dynamic web applications by embedding code within HTML and dealing with databases.
6- Security: Web servers play a crucial role in maintaining web application security. 
They handle tasks like SSL/TLS encryption to secure data transmission, manage access controls, 
and implement security measures to protect against vulnerabilities and attacks.
7- Load balancing: In high-traffic scenarios or for large-scale applications, web servers may employ load balancing techniques.
Load balancers distribute incoming requests across multiple web servers to ensure efficient utilization of resources and improve overall performance and availability.

Let's Talk About **Dynamic VS Static Web Server** :

Static web server: A static web server includes hardware or a computer with an HTTP server. These servers are known as static as they help display hosted content.
The best example of a static web server is an *NGINX web server*.

Dynamic web server: Dynamic web servers include a static server, application server, and database.
It is known as dynamic as it uses the application server to update hosted files before sending them to the user's browser via HTTP. 
A dynamic website can update and display different content such as images, videos, and HTML.
One of the best examples of dynamic web servers is an *Apache web server*.

**Additional Examples of Web Servers:**
Microsoft Internet Information Services
lighttpd
Sun Java System Web Server
Linux web server software

Let's Talk About**Apache vs Nginx**as An Example of **benefits and drawbacks of different web servers**

**1. Apache HTTP Server:**
*Benefits:*
- It's open-source and free.
- It's highly reliable.
- It has a large user community.
- It's highly customizable with a variety of modules.

*Drawbacks:*
- It can consume a lot of memory, especially under heavy load.
- It may not perform as well as other servers under high traffic.

**2. Nginx:**
*Benefits:*
- It's known for its high performance and low memory usage.
- It's excellent for serving static content.
- It can also act as a reverse proxy and load balancer.

*Drawbacks:*
- While it's capable of dynamic content serving, it's not as straightforward as with some other servers.
- Its module system is not as flexible as Apache's.

To help you choose between the two web servers, Let’s review each category we have compared:

- Basic architecture – Apache generates a single thread for each connection request, whereas NGINX can handle multiple connections simultaneously with a single process.
- Performance – NGINX outperforms Apache in serving static content, but it requires additional software to process dynamic content. On the other hand, Apache can natively process dynamic content.
- Directory-level configuration – Apache enables .htaccess configuration, which allows users to adjust their site’s settings without modifying the main server.
Meanwhile, NGINX doesn’t support directory-level configuration.
- Modules –  Apache modules can be dynamically loaded, while NGINX modules need to be compiled within the core software.
- Security – Both Apache and NGINX are secure and reliable, with several tools available to protect a site from DDoS attacks
- Support – Both Apache and NGINX provide community support and documentation to assist beginners with issues. However, direct support is offered by NGINX on its premium version.

In conclusion, while Apache offers flexibility and a wide range of modules, NGINX provides scalability, speed, and multifunctionality as a reverse proxy server.

## Proxy Servers

The server acts as an intermediary between a client device (such as a computer or smartphone) and the internet.
It facilitates network requests on behalf of the client, allowing it to access resources from other servers.

**Here's how proxy servers work:**

When a client device requests a resource (like a web page), 
1- it sends the request to the proxy server instead of directly contacting the target server.

2- The proxy server receives the client's request and forwards it to the target server on behalf of the client.

3- The target server processes the request and sends the response back to the proxy server.

4- The proxy server receives the response from the target server and forwards it back to the client device.

By acting as an intermediary, **a proxy server can provide various functionalities and benefits, such as:**

Caching: Proxy servers can cache frequently accessed resources. When a client requests a cached resource, 
the proxy server can serve it directly, reducing response time and network traffic.

Anonymity: Proxy servers can hide the client's IP address, making it harder for websites to track their browsing activities.
This is particularly useful for maintaining privacy and bypassing certain restrictions.

Content filtering: Proxy servers can filter and block specific types of content, such as advertisements, malware, or inappropriate websites. 
This feature is often used by organizations to enforce acceptable use policies.

Load balancing: Proxy servers can distribute client requests across multiple servers, balancing the load and preventing individual servers from becoming overwhelmed.

**Different types of proxy servers:**

Forward proxy: Also known as an "outbound" proxy, a forward proxy is used by clients to access resources from the internet.
It represents the client and forwards requests to target servers.

Reverse proxy: A reverse proxy, also called an "inbound" proxy, sits between client devices and servers. It handles requests from clients and forwards them to the appropriate server. Reverse proxies are often used to improve performance, security, and scalability.

Transparent proxy: Transparent proxies intercept network traffic without modifying it.
They are typically used by network administrators to enforce policies or monitor traffic without requiring client configuration.

Anonymous proxy: Anonymous proxies hide the client's IP address, providing a level of anonymity.
They are commonly used to bypass restrictions or access blocked content.

High anonymity proxy: High anonymity proxies not only hide the client's IP address but also modify or remove identifying information from the client's requests.
They provide a higher level of privacy and are often used for sensitive activities.

**The benefits and drawbacks of different proxy servers, For example:**

Forward proxies can improve security by acting as a firewall and providing anonymity, but they may introduce additional latency and require client configuration.

Reverse proxies can enhance performance and handle SSL encryption, but they may add complexity to the server infrastructure.

**How To Use a Proxy Server**
To use a proxy server, You typically need to configure your device or application to route its network traffic through the proxy. 
The specific steps vary depending on the operating system or software you're using.
In general, you'll need the IP address or domain name of the proxy server and the port number it uses.
You can usually find these details from the proxy server provider or your network administrator.
For Example in Windows: 
For Windows 10, you can access the proxy settings from the Settings app > Network & Internet > Proxy.

## OSI Model 

The OSI model, also known as Open Systems Interconnection, offers a straightforward and intuitive approach to standardize the components needed for network communication.

By dividing the requirements into multiple layers, the model provides a clear understanding of what is necessary to communicate within a network.

The structure of the OSI model consists of seven layers: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical.

The top three layers are typically implemented within the operating system's software, while the bottom three layers are typically implemented within hardware devices like switches, routers, and firewalls on the network.

Layer 4, known as the Transport layer, acts as the connection point between the software and hardware layers.

Each layer in the OSI model serves a specific purpose:

**The Application Layer**
the layer encompasses the functionality of applications and allows users to interact with network services. Examples of applications include HTTP and FTP.

**The Presentation Layer**
the layer is responsible for adapting, transforming, and translating data to ensure compatibility and understanding between applications and lower layers.

**The Session Layer**
the layer manages connections between applications and lower layers, including establishing, maintaining, and terminating connections.

**The Transport Layer**
the layer enables the representation of applications on the network. Notable protocols at this layer include TCP and UDP.

**The Network Layer**
the layer handles routing packets between networks through routers. It utilizes the Internet Protocol (IP) and deals with IP addresses.

**The Data Link Layer**
the layer establishes links between networks and facilitates the transmission of packets through physical connections. It handles MAC addresses and bridges the gap between the physical and logical (network) layers.

**The Physical Layer** 
the layer acts as a bridge between the digital information processed by higher layers and the physical transmission medium.

While the OSI model itself is not directly tied to backend development, it provides a foundational understanding of how data flows through a network.
This knowledge can be relevant for backend developers who work on networked applications.

## HTTP
HTTP, short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a protocol used to retrieve resources, primarily HTML documents, from the web.
It serves as the foundation for data exchange on the internet and operates as a client-server protocol.
Unlike a continuous stream of data, communication between clients (like web browsers) and servers occurs through individual messages known as requests and responses.

When a client sends an HTTP request, typically initiated by a web browser, a web server receives it and processes the request using an application.
The server then sends back an HTTP response as an answer.
This process takes place over either a TCP connection or a TLS-encrypted TCP connection, as HTTP is an application layer protocol.

The HTTP request/response cycle involves the following steps: 
1. The client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the web.
2. The web server receives the request.
3. The server runs an application to handle the request.
4. The server sends back an HTTP response (output) to the browser.
5. The client (browser) receives the response.

In the HTTP request circle, the browser requests various resources like HTML pages or style sheets, and the server responds by providing the corresponding files.

HTTP is crucial in backend development as it facilitates seamless data transfer and communication between clients and servers. 
It establishes a standardized protocol for building web applications, APIs, and other backend systems.

## IP

IP Addressing:
In order for computers on the Internet to communicate with each other, 
they must have unique addresses called IP addresses. These addresses allow other computers to locate and deliver requested files or web pages.
IP addresses are governed by the Internet Protocol, which consists of a set of rules that enable the functioning of the Internet.
Similar to languages, IP addresses use protocols to send and receive data or files between connected devices.
There are two types of IP addresses: IPv4, which consists of four numbers separated by dots, 
and IPv6, which is a 128-bit address providing a vast number of unique addresses for future use.

Ports:
A port or port number is a numerical identifier assigned to connection endpoints to direct data to a specific service. 
It operates at the software level within an operating system and is managed in the Transport Layer. 
Ports are logical constructs that identify a particular process or network service.
The most commonly used transport protocols associated with port numbers are TCP and UDP. 
Examples of common port numbers include port 80 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS, port 20 and 21 for FTP, and port 25 for SMTP.

TCP/IP:
TCP/IP is the communication protocol used for interconnecting computers on the Internet. 
It stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and defines how devices should connect to the Internet and transmit data between them. 
TCP/IP is utilized by web browsers to access Internet servers and by email programs for sending and receiving emails.
It comprises various protocols, including TCP, UDP, IP, ICMP, and DHCP, which handle different aspects of data communication and network addressing.

The Relationship between TCP/IP and IP:
TCP/IP combines the functions of TCP and IP. TCP manages communication between application software (like a browser) and network software, while IP handles communication with other computers.
TCP is responsible for breaking down data into IP packets before transmission and reassembling them upon arrival, while IP ensures that the packets are sent to the correct destination.

The Relationship between TCP/IP and Backend Development:
Although TCP/IP is not directly tied to backend development concepts like server-side programming or data storage, a solid understanding of TCP/IP is essential for backend developers to effectively design, implement, and maintain networked applications and services.
It enables them to work with protocols, handle data communication, and ensure seamless connectivity between systems.

## REST API

First of All, let us know what's API:

### API

API or Application Programming Interface is a Concept of Creating a mediator or a gateway between Clients (such as your Browsers) and resources (such as Data from a Database or media like images and videos) on the web
without direct connections to these resources, applying the concept of encapsulation to add an extra layer of security to server resources.

### REST 

Representational State Transfer (REST):
REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style commonly used in designing web services. 
It provides a set of principles and constraints for building scalable, stateless, and interoperable web APIs.

Features of REST include:

Resource-based: REST models resources as the fundamental entities. A resource can be any information that is addressable via a unique URL.
Resources can be accessed, created, modified, or deleted using standard HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
This means you should define which method to use to access your Resources

Stateless: REST is stateless, meaning that each request from a client to a server should contain all the necessary information for the server to process that request. 
The server does not maintain any knowledge of previous requests, which simplifies the architecture and promotes scalability because the server does not need to maintain any client state, This allows for easy distribution of requests across multiple servers,
enabling horizontal scaling to handle high-traffic loads.

Uniform interface: REST follows a uniform set of interface constraints It indicates that the server transfers information in a standard format to ensure simplicity and consistency. 
This includes using standard HTTP methods for operations (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE),
utilizing HTTP status codes for indicating the outcome of a request (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found),
and employing resource representations (such as JSON or XML) for data exchange.

Client-server architecture: REST separates the client and server responsibilities.
The client is responsible for the user interface and user experience, 
while the server handles data storage, processing, and exposing resources via APIs.
This separation allows for independent evolution and scalability of both components.

Stateless caching: REST encourages the use of caching to improve performance and reduce server load.
Clients can cache responses from the server, and the server can provide cache directives to control caching behavior.

### RESTful API

Simply is an API that uses REST architecture and rules and that adds to the API the simplicity, scalability, and compatibility with the existing HTTP infrastructure.
It enables interoperability between different systems and allows clients to interact with server resources in a consistent and predictable manner.

### Benefits of RESTFUL APIs

In addition to REST features I mentioned above, RESTful API IS:

1- Lightweight: Because REST APIs rely on HTTP standards which allows you to use XML, JSON, and HTML 
As your transferable data that makes REST APIs have a high performance and speed which is necessary for mobile applications, internet of things devices, and more. 

2- Flexible and compatible: REST APIs are flexible and independent of technologies, making them compatible with various platforms and technologies.

3- Easy to organize complicated applications: REST APIs provide a structured approach to organizing complex applications.
