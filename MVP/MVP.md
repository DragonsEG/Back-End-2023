# Purpose of an MVP

The purpose of building an MVP is to launch a product quickly, based on an established idea, with a small budget. MVP development solutions allow businesses to collect users’ feedback for the primary product and include it in future iterations. With an MVP, one can find the right audience, pull the ideas based on experience, and save time.

## Stats Emphasizing the Need to Build an MVP 
 
- 29% of startups fail because they run out of cash.
- Startups that scale properly grow 20 times faster than those that scale prematurely.

These stats explicitly show the benefits of beginning the new product development process with an MVP. However, there are more reasons that an MVP product development company has to build a Minimum Viable Product:

- Creating an initial model that provides a starting point for discussions and offers clear visual points of reference.
- Conducting initial idea approval includes sharing the model with a few prospects and testing it with genuine users. This helps in understanding the issues that may become apparent with the product.
- Starting the actual building process after dedicating months to improving and refining the software idea is a significant and motivating step toward building a fully-fledged product.

## What are the key components of an MVP and how can we prioritize the necessary features?

The key components of a successful MVP:

1. Identify the target audience.
2. Built for one person.
3. Only essential features.
4. Highly-skilled development company.
5. Focus on testing.
6. Small, contained launch.
7. Be prepared to pivot.

### 1. Identify the target audience

Identifying the right group of the target audience is the most essential strategy of a business. The features, which are considered for MVP, should be valuable to the end user.

### 2. Built for one person

A successful MVP should be built for one person. This means that it should be designed to solve a specific problem for a specific user.

### 3. Only essential features

Don't try to build an MVP with every possible feature included. Instead, build an MVP around the essentials.

### 4. Highly-skilled development company

If you can find a professional IT team as your backbone when building an MVP, but it's not recommended you can use low code, no code solutions and automation to build your first product.

### 5. Focus on testing

A successful MVP should be focused on testing. This means that it should be designed to collect user feedback to make further integrations based on the needs of the target audience.

### 6. Small, contained launch

A successful MVP should have a small, contained launch. This means that it should be launched to a small group of early adopters to validate the product idea.

### 7. Be prepared to pivot

As you get feedback, be prepared to make changes to your product.

By following these key components, you can create a successful MVP that will help you launch your startup and achieve your business goals.

## How can we create an effective MVP and gather valuable feedback on it?

### Step 1: Start with Market Research

At times, ideas will not fit the market needs. Before a business initiates an idea and embarks upon an MVP Development process, it should ensure that it fulfills the target users’ needs. Any business would gain by conducting surveys. The more information a business has, the higher the chances of success. Also, do not forget to keep an eye on what the competitors offer and how the product idea can stand out.

*It is not enough to do your best; you must know what to do and then do your best.* – W. Edwards Deming

A survey conducted by CB Insights revealed that the number one reason for a startup’s failure was a ‘lack of market need.’ If the product doesn’t nail the problem, customers won’t go along with it to find a solution.

### Step 2: Ideate on Value Addition

What value does the new product offer its users? How can it benefit them? Why would they buy the product? The answers to these questions can help define the app’s value proposition.

It should also be clear what the essential estimations are for the product. As MVP implies, the product has to introduce value to the people in its most basic state. Begin by outlining the users and build the MVP based on their needs.

### Step 3: Map Out User Flow

The design process is a vital MVP stage. Hence, you must design the app in a way that is convenient for users. The business needs to look at the app from the users’ perspective, starting from opening the app to the final process, such as making a purchase or delivery. In addition, user flow is important because it ensures nothing will be missed while keeping future product and user satisfaction in mind.

Defining the user flow is necessary to determine the process stages. It is essential to explain the steps needed to reach the main objective. The focus should be on basic tasks such as finding and buying the product or managing and receiving orders rather than features.

These are the goals that the end-users will have while using the product. When each of these procedure stages is laid out, it is time to define the features of each step.

### Step 4: Prioritize MVP Features

At this stage, prioritize all the features that the MVP will support. To prioritize the MVP features, ask questions such as: What do the users want? Is this product offering them something beneficial?

Next, categorize all the remaining MVP features based on high priority, medium priority, and low priority. Another essential step is to arrange these features in the product backlog (priority-wise). It is time to begin building an MVP. If a business wants to see how its future product will look, it can create an MVP prototype.

*Fun Fact: Steve Jobs was out of his job because of avoiding the stage of prototyping while building the Apple Lisa. The result was a disaster as it failed to achieve a good number of sales.*

### Step 5: Launch MVP

Once a business has decided upon the main features and learned about the market needs, it can create the MVP. Remember that an MVP is not lower quality than a final product but still needs to fulfill the customer’s needs. Therefore, it must be easy to use, engaging, and suitable for the users.

*The main reason why products fail is that they don’t meet customers’ needs in a way that is better than other alternatives.* – Dan Olsen, author of The Lean Product Playbook

### Step 6: Exercise ‘B.M.L.’ — Build, Measure, Learn

Everything is part of a process: first, define the scope of work, then move the product to the development stage. After the product development phase, the product must be tested. The first testing stage is carried out by Quality Assurance engineers who work to improve the product’s quality (even if the product is not yet released).

### Step 7: Receiving feedback and analyzing results

I believe that measuring the results is the most important part of the MVP development process. This is the real test for the viability of your product and it will determine the future direction in final product development.

Listen carefully to what the users have to say. Even though you cannot satisfy every user in the market, user feedback can give you a very precise idea of the improvement of the features.

Modifying and tweaking are part of the development process of your product and you need to be prepared to adjust your product to the market needs.

You may need to run tests with adjustments several times before you are ready to develop the final product.

Adjusting and optimizing MVP for tests may seem like an unnecessary step but it gives you an opportunity to adapt the product perfectly to customer needs which can result in higher engagement and profit when the final version is released.

After launching the MVP, go over everything again. The company must get feedback from its clients on the release. They can determine the acceptance and competitiveness of their goods in the market based on their comments.

## What Is the Cost to Build MVP App?

Several key factors determine the cost of building an MVP.

Many founders assume that the cost of app development depends on the types of technology used, but this is not true.

Your product development budget is just one side of the coin. It is equally important that the project is delivered on time, and the idea behind the project is strong.

If the product owner wants to create an excellent product, it is vital to choose developers wisely.

Let’s take a look at some options you have.

### Option 1: Hire Freelancers [Cheap and Cheerful]

It is a quick, cheap, and easy way to start a project.

There are many freelance platforms to help you find developers that can fit your needs. Good platforms to start are freelancer.com, upwork.com, fiverr.com.

The main problem in hiring freelance developers is their lack of obligations towards the project.

When something goes wrong, they can easily just leave. It also means you have to become a project manager, and all coordination and communication are your own responsibility.

This issue is pretty hard to manage. If you still wish to hire freelance developers, my advice is to involve those who are local.

For a typical project, you would need to hire a full-time team. Let’s consider the rates of freelance software developers.

- A full-stack developer costs about $6,000 per month. This specialist is required across the entire project development.
- A designer costs around $5,000 per month. This specialist is needed at the beginning of the project.
- You will need a tester throughout the entire development process. This specialist will cost you around $2,500 per month.

Thus, the overall cost will be up to $13,000 per month. Below is a chart outlining the current salaries of freelancers across the world.

### Option 2: Build an in-House Team [Expensive and Transparent]

Sometimes founders choose in-house software development. It provides transparent relations and clear communication.

In-house development lets the team be fully involved in the project. The quality is still your responsibility. Your developers are more motivated by the success of the application and company, though.

An internal team is also much easier to coordinate.

The main disadvantage of this option is significantly higher cost. It could be a problem if you start with a limited budget.

When you are employing full-time developers, you are required to pay holiday costs and hiring costs as well as many other expenses. Make sure your project requires this level of spending at the MVP stage.

How much would it cost? Let’s take the same team.

- A full-stack developer costs an average of $9,200 per month.
- A designer costs $3,600 per month.
- A tester costs $4,100 per month.
- And a project manager costs $7,500 per month.

So, in-house development will cost you about $25,000 per month. Below is a chart outlining the current salaries of developers across the world.

### Option 3: Hire a Local Team [If You Have Unlimited Budget]

Local product development is also an expensive option. But the price includes developed business and technology processes.

You would get a dedicated development team, a project manager, and a tester with the level of involvement and legally documented procedures.

Clutch.co or GoodFirms.com are good options to find a well-known local agency. These sites show ratings and feedback from previous customers to help you choose a proficient and reliable team.

The agency rates vary from $100 to $250 per hour for one specialist. That means that the same team will cost you at least $400 per hour.

However, you need to ask yourself whether you are ready to pay up to $64,000 per month to test your business hypotheses. If the answer is yes, this is a good option.

### Option 4: Outsource MVP Development [Reasonable Cost, Reliable Results]

Outsourcing is quite a popular option for many startups. It’s like hiring a local agency, but at a twice-trice lower price.

There are two main challenges when outsourcing your product development:

1. Building trust.
2. Involving the team.

However, both of both issues are easily managed. Make sure you have thoroughly researched the potential agencies before hiring them. You can do this by checking reviews, company websites, and looking at recent case studies.

## What is the cost to build an MVP with an outsourcing agency?

Let’s take Ukrainian outsourcers as an example.

Their average price is $30 per hour. Thus, a four-person team will cost $120 per hour. That means you will have to pay up to $19,000 per month to build an MVP.

## How does the development process for an MVP differ from standard development?

The difference is that an MVP is the first version of your product that is released with a sufficient set of features to test the product and gather relevant user feedback for the success of further software development.

## Are there certain projects that are better suited for an MVP, and is it challenging to create one for a specific project?

Yes, It depends on the specific project and its requirements. Creating an MVP can be challenging, especially if the project has complex features or a tight deadline. However, the goal of an MVP is to simplify the initial development and testing process, so it can also make project development more manageable.



## Is it advisable to use third-party services when creating an MVP?
Yes. I think it will help significantly speed up the development process and reduce costs allowing me to focus on building the core features of my MVP. It is necessary to choose reliable and well-documented external services that match the project requirements.

## When is it appropriate to take your MVP to the next level, and what are the next steps?

If you collect feedback that shows customers care and will pay,

The next stage after MVP is MMP (Minimum Marketable Product). MMP is sometimes called MMR (minimum marketable version) but the terminology is fairly similar. While an MVP helps you understand customer needs better, an MMP helps you figure out if an idea is worth taking further. By developing and testing an MVP, you should have a better idea of what needs to be improved before launching it to a wider market. However, those who have downloaded or used your MVP are called “early adopters.” These people find new products exciting and interesting. They're a core group, but they don't make up your broader customer base. Now you need to make sure your product is suitable for a wider market. A broader customer base will have higher expectations. You have to make sure that your product is ready for them. If you're wondering why you should care about MMP, you might consider the fact that Dropbox has reached 1 million users in less than a year with its MMP. Many other big names have done the same: Uber, Airbnb, and Groupon, to name a few.


### I would like to tell you the story of Dropbox (-_-)

Founded in 2007 by MIT students Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, Dropbox is an impressive file hosting service that currently provides customers with extensive cloud features such as personal cloud, client software, cloud storage, and file syncing. When the founders came up with the idea of a cloud-based file sync service, they realized that building a physical hardware infrastructure would be incredibly expensive and time-consuming. So they took a micro-approach to testing the idea and produced a simple video (like an MVP) telling potential investors what the product would offer customers once it was built and launched.

Despite its simplicity, the video was a huge success and encouraged more than 70,000 people to subscribe from people interested in learning more. The feedback provided was also pivotal in building and evolving Dropbox into what it is today. They also reverse-engineered Apple's finder system to present their icon on the top dock. Intrigued, Steve Jobs also offered to take over the company. Despite multiple opportunities to sell the company in the early stages, Dropbox has shown an amazing rise as its founders solve the messiest of dilemmas: “How do you get all your files, from all your devices, in one place?” The site currently offers 100GB of storage space for a basic subscription of $10 per month, and its 50 million users have tripled.


## Can MVP be used for projects of any size, and is there a recommended timeframe for feature releases after MVP?
 
Varies based on project complexity and goals.

Timing of feature releases depends on:

User Feedback: Launch additional features based on user feedback and needs. If users require specific functionality, prioritize it.

Development resources: The availability of development resources can affect the speed of feature releases. More resources may lead to faster development.

Business goals: Align feature releases with your business goals and objectives. Some features may be time sensitive and need to be released sooner.

Competitive Landscape: Monitor the competition and release features that keep your product competitive.

Complexity: The complexity of features can affect the development time. Some features may be easy to implement, while others may be more complex.

Testing and Quality Assurance: Make sure new features are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards before release. Hasty releases can lead to problems and setbacks.


## Should senior developers or junior/trainee developers be tasked with creating an MVP?
Yes, but this depends on factors such as project complexity, timeline and guidance
