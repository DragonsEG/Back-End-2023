Web servers are a fundamental component of the internet, serving as the backbone that enables websites and applications to be accessible online. In this section, we'll explore the key aspects of web servers, including their definition, functionality, types, common examples, and the advantages and disadvantages they bring to the table.
What is a Web Server?
At its core, a web server is a specialized computer tasked with hosting web pages, making them available to users over the internet. When a user accesses a website, the web server is responsible for retrieving the relevant web page files and delivering them to the user's web browser. This interaction allows users to interact with the web content seamlessly.
How do Web Servers Work?
Web servers operate within the client-server model, where one program, referred to as the client, requests resources or services from another program, known as the server. Web servers primarily use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to respond to user requests made via the World Wide Web. HTTP serves as the protocol for exchanging information between computers.
To provide a better understanding, here's an overview of the process:
1.	When a user wishes to load a website, their web browser seeks the web server hosting the site's files.
2.	The browser translates the site's domain name into an IP address through the Domain Name System (DNS). It may also check its cache for frequent visits to the site.
3.	Once the corresponding web server is located, the browser sends an HTTP request to retrieve the site's content.
4.	The web server receives and processes this HTTP request using its HTTP server, accessing the necessary data from its database.
5.	Finally, the server sends the requested files back to the web browser for user interaction.
In cases where the web server fails to find or process the requested files, it returns an HTTP error status code to the browser. Common examples include the 404 error for missing pages, the 403 error for permission issues, and the 504 error for unresponsive proxy or gateway servers.
