Task 2 : Learn about Git and GitHub (Reseach)

What is version control ?
Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to track modifications, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with others on a project. It provides a history of changes made to files, facilitates collaboration among team members, and helps manage different versions or branches of the project.

What is Git ?
Git is a version control system widely used in software development. Git allows developers to efficiently track and manage changes in a software project, as well as the ability to work collaboratively with development teams.
Git allows users to easily create copies of the project (branches) and merge changes between these copies in a secure and organized manner. Git is based on a distributed model where developers can work on the project independently and merge their changes later. This facilitates work on large projects and allows for effective collaboration between different team members. It is one of the most famous types of version control.

Why GitHub works only with git ?
Git has a rich ecosystem of tools, integrations, and services built around it. By focusing on Git, GitHub taps into this ecosystem and provides developers with a wide range of integrations for continuous integration, code review, project management, and more. This ecosystem enhances the development workflow and makes GitHub a comprehensive platform for software development.
GitHub's decision to work exclusively with Git is based on Git's popularity, distributed nature, powerful capabilities, ecosystem, and alignment with open source principles.

Add git to the project
To add Git to a project, you need to initialize a Git repository in the project's root directory. This can be done using the git init command. Once the repository is initialized, you can start tracking changes to files using commands like git add to stage changes and git commit to create a new commit with those changes. Git provides various other commands and workflows to manage branches, collaborate with other developers, handle conflicts, and more.

Main vs branches
In Git, the main branch is typically called the "master" branch. The main branch represents the stable, production-ready version of the project. Branches, on the other hand, are separate lines of development that allow for the isolation and independent work on specific features, bug fixes, or experiments. Developers can create new branches, make changes in isolation, and merge those changes back into the main branch when they are ready.

Branches are useful for managing concurrent development, enabling teams to work on different features or fixes independently without interfering with each other. They provide a way to test changes, review code, and ensure stability before merging them into the main branch.
