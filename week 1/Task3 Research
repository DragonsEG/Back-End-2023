# REST API

## Introduction to API

Before delving into RESTful APIs, let's understand the concept of API:

### API - Bridging the Gap

API, or Application Programming Interface, acts as an intermediary or gateway between clients (like web browsers) and resources (such as data from databases or media files) on the web. It establishes a secure layer of encapsulation, ensuring that clients don't have direct access to server resources.

### REST - A Web Service Architecture

**Representational State Transfer (REST)** is a prevalent architectural style for designing web services. It offers a set of principles and constraints that facilitate the development of scalable, stateless, and interoperable web APIs.

**Key features of REST**:

- **Resource-based:** REST treats resources as the core entities. These resources can be any information accessible via a unique URL. To interact with resources, standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) are used, requiring the specification

- **Stateless:** REST is stateless, meaning that each client request to the server must contain all the necessary information for processing. This absence of server-side memory regarding previous requests simplifies the architecture and promotes scalability.

- **Uniform Interface:** REST adheres to a consistent set of interface constraints, ensuring simplicity and consistency. It uses standard HTTP methods for operations, HTTP status codes for request outcomes (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found), and resource representations (e.g., JSON or XML) for data exchange.

- **Client-Server Architecture:** REST separates client and server responsibilities. The client focuses on user interface and experience, while the server manages data storage, processing, and resource exposure via APIs. This separation allows both components to evolve independently and scale efficiently.

- **Stateless Caching:** REST encourages the use of caching to boost performance and reduce server load. Clients can cache responses, and the server can provide cache directives to control caching behavior.

### RESTful API - Simplicity and Compatibility
A RESTful API is an API that adheres to REST architecture and principles. It combines the simplicity, scalability, and compatibility with the existing HTTP infrastructure. This approach fosters interoperability between diverse systems, ensuring clients interact with server resources consistently and predictably.

### Benefits of RESTful APIs
Beyond the fundamental features of REST, RESTful APIs offer several advantages:

1. **Lightweight:** REST APIs rely on HTTP standards, allowing the use of lightweight data transfer formats like XML, JSON, and HTML. This results in high performance, making them suitable for mobile apps, IoT devices, and more.

2. **Flexibility and Compatibility:** REST APIs are flexible and technology-agnostic, ensuring compatibility with various platforms and technologies.

3. **Efficient Organization:** REST APIs provide a structured approach to organizing complex applications.

# Proxy Servers

Proxy servers act as intermediaries between clients and requested servers. They provide an additional layer of security for clients and can enhance performance by caching frequently requested data or serving as load balancers, distributing requests to available servers. There are various types of proxy servers, each with unique security and performance characteristics:

## Forward Proxy

A forward proxy sits in front of clients and is used to provide data to groups of users within an internal network. It examines incoming requests to decide whether to proceed with making a connection.

## Transparent Proxy

A transparent proxy offers users an experience identical to that of using their home computers. Users may be connected to it without their knowledge.

## Anonymous Proxy

An anonymous proxy focuses on making internet activity untraceable. It works by accessing the internet on behalf of the user while hiding their identity and computer information.

High Anonymity Proxy :
A high anonymity proxy is an anonymous proxy that takes anonymity one step further. It works by erasing your information before the proxy attempts to connect to the target site.
## Distorting Proxy :
A distorting proxy identifies itself as a proxy to a website but hides its own identity. It does this by changing its IP address to an incorrect one.
## Data Center Proxy:
Data center proxies are not affiliated with an internet service provider (ISP) but are provided by another corporation through a data center. The proxy server exists in a physical data center, and the user’s requests are routed through that server.
## Residential Proxy:
A residential proxy gives you an IP address that belongs to a specific, physical device. All requests are then channeled through that device.
## Public Proxy:
A public proxy is accessible by anyone free of charge. It works by giving users access to its IP address, hiding their identity as they visit sites.
## Shared Proxy:
Shared proxies are used by more than one user at once. They give you access to an IP address that may be shared by other people, and then you can surf the internet while appearing to browse from a location of your choice.
## SSL Proxy:
A secure sockets layer (SSL) proxy provides decryption between the client and the server. As the data is encrypted in both directions, the proxy hides its existence from both the client and the server.
## Rotating Proxy:
A rotating proxy assigns a different IP address to each user that connects to it. As users connect, they are given an address that is unique from the device that connected before it.
## Reverse Proxy:
Unlike a forward proxy, which sits in front of clients, a reverse proxy is positioned in front of web servers and forwards requests from a browser to the web servers. It works by intercepting requests from the user at the network edge of the web server. It then sends the requests to and receives replies from the origin server.

Acting as a crucial intermediary, it bridges the gap between a user's web browser and the desired web content. Remarkably, it can host either a single website or multiple websites while utilizing the same software and hardware resources efficiently.

Let's delve into the inner workings of web servers through a straightforward example. Picture yourself at your computer, eager to visit a website. You launch your web browser, enter the website's URL, and press "Enter." In response, your browser dispatches a request to the web server associated with the desired website. The web server, upon receiving your request, meticulously scrutinizes it for validity. Its primary objective is to ascertain that your request aligns with the resources it can provide and that you possess the requisite permissions. Assuming your request garners approval, the web server embarks on a mission to locate the web page or resources you seek. Once it successfully locates the web page, it swiftly transmits it back to your web browser. This entire process adheres to the standards of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or the more secure HTTPS (HTTP Secure).

Diverse types of web servers exist, but let's focus on the most prevalent ones:

# OSI Model  

# Unveiling the OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model serves as a user-friendly and intuitive blueprint for standardizing the intricate components essential for seamless communication across networks.

This model offers a systematic breakdown of the prerequisites for effective network communication by partitioning them into a structured hierarchy of seven layers: 

1. **Physical**
2. **Data Link**
3. **Network**
4. **Transport**
5. **Session**
6. **Presentation**
7. **Application**

The top trio of layers finds their residence within the realm of software, residing within the bosom of the Operating System. In stark contrast, the bottom three layers find their embodiment as hardware components inhabiting network devices such as Switches, Routers, and Firewalls. Layer 4, known as the Transport layer, bridges the realms of software and hardware, creating a vital link between the two.

## The OSI Model Unveiled

Let's embark on a journey through the layers of the OSI model:

# Networking Basics

## IP Addressing

In the vast world of the internet, all computers communicate using underground, underwater cables, or wireless connections. For any online activity, whether it's downloading files, loading web pages, or anything else, your computer needs a unique address known as an IP Address or Internet Protocol Address.

- **Internet Protocol**: This is essentially a set of rules that govern how the internet functions.

IP addresses work like languages; they use specific protocols to transmit information. Behind the scenes, several steps occur:

### Types of IP Address

1. **IPv4**: Internet Protocol version 4. It comprises four numbers separated by dots, with each number ranging from 0 to 255 in decimal format.

   - **IPv4 Classes**:
     - Class A: 1-126
     - Class B: 128-191
     - Class C: 192-223
     - Class D: 224-239 (Reserved for multitasking)
     - Class E: 240-254 (Reserved for Research and development)

2. **IPv6**: This is a 128-bit IP address, providing a staggering number of unique addresses (2^128) for future generations.

## Ports

A port or port number is a unique identifier for a connection endpoint at the software level within an operating system. Ports are essential for directing data to specific services.

- Ports are managed at the Transport Layer.
- They are logical constructs that identify processes or types of network services.
- Common transport protocols using port numbers include TCP and UDP.

Example port numbers include:
- 80: HTTP
- 443: HTTP Secure (HTTPS)
- 20, 21: File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
- 25: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)

## TCP/IP

TCP/IP is the core communication protocol for connecting computers on the internet. It stands for Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol and governs how electronic devices should connect to the internet and exchange data.

- Browsers use TCP/IP to access internet servers, and servers use it to send HTML back to browsers.
- Email programs rely on TCP/IP for sending and receiving emails.
- Internet addressing is a fundamental part of the TCP/IP protocol.

Inside the TCP/IP standard, several protocols handle data communication:

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Manages communication between applications.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Facilitates simple communication between applications.
- **IP (Internet Protocol)**: Ensures communication between computers.
- **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**: Deals with errors and statistics.
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**: Provides dynamic addressing.

### Relationship between TCP/IP and IP

TCP/IP is a synergy of TCP and IP. TCP manages communication between application software and network software, while IP takes care of communication with other computers. TCP breaks data into IP packets before sending them and reassembles packets upon arrival. IP ensures packets reach their correct destination.

### The Relationship between TCP/IP and Backend Development

Although TCP/IP isn't directly tied to backend development concepts like server-side programming or data storage, it's crucial knowledge for backend developers. It enables them to design, implement, and maintain networked applications and services effectively.

# Understanding HTTP: The Backbone of Web Communication

## Introduction to HTTP

HTTP, or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, serves as the fundamental framework for fetching various resources, most notably HTML documents, on the web. This protocol underpins all data exchanges on the internet and operates on a client-server model.

In the realm of HTTP, clients (typically web browsers) and servers engage in communication through discrete messages, distinct from a continuous data stream. The client's messages are known as requests, while the server's responses are aptly named.

HTTP operates at the application layer and traverses the internet via the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or a secure TLS-encrypted TCP connection.

## The Dance of HTTP Requests and Responses

1. A client, often a web browser, initiates an HTTP request directed at a web resource.
2. The web server on the other end receives this request.
3. The server employs an application to process the received request.
4. In return, the server formulates an HTTP response, which serves as its output.
5. The client, i.e., the web browser, dutifully receives and processes this response.

## The HTTP Request Cycle

The HTTP request cycle orchestrates the exchange of specific resources between the client and server. For instance:

- The browser may request an HTML page, to which the server responds with an HTML file.
- A request for a style sheet prompts the server to furnish a CSS file.
- And so on, as the cycle continues.

## HTTP's Crucial Role in Backend Development

HTTP stands as an indispensable element of backend development. It plays a pivotal role in facilitating the smooth transmission of data and communication between clients and servers. This protocol offers a standardized framework for constructing web applications, APIs, and other backend systems.
