# TASK WEEK 1

# Research Task 


**1- what is the version control ??**

-Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time. This allows you to track the history of your work, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with others.

**2- git and github meaning ??**

-Git is a popular distributed version control system (DVCS). This means that each developer has a full copy of the repository, including its history, on their local machine. This makes it easy to work offline and collaborate with others without having to rely on a central server.

-GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides a number of features that make it easy to collaborate with others, such as code review, issue tracking, and pull requests.



**3- why GitHub works only with git ?!**

Git is the most popular DVCS, and it is the most well-supported by GitHub. Additionally, Git is a very flexible and powerful DVCS, making it a good choice for a wide variety of projects.

**4- how to add git to the project ?!**

To add Git to a project:

  1-Create a new Git repository. You can do this using the git init command.
  2-Add your project files to the repository. You can do this using the git add command.
  3-Commit your changes to the repository. You can do this using the git commit command.
  4-Push your changes to GitHub. You can do this using the git push command.

# Main vs branches

- •The main branch is the default branch in Git. It is the branch that is typically deployed to production.

- •Branches are used to isolate changes from the main branch. This allows you to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the production version of your code.

- •Once you are finished working on a branch, you can merge it into the main branch. This will make your changes available in production.

- •Here is an example of how to use branches in Git:
    1-Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. You can do this using the git checkout -b <branch_name> command.
    2-Make your changes on the branch.
    3-Commit your changes to the branch.
    4-Push your changes to GitHub.
    5-Create a pull request to merge your branch into the main branch.
    6-Once your pull request is approved and merged, your changes will be available in production.

- •Branches are a powerful tool that can help you to manage your development workflow and collaborate with others.
